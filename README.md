## Some important notice

* Sometimes when your first compile the
program the model is off-centered, try to
resize the window which will re-centered the model.

## How to run

* For example, by typing `make FILE="./assets/dolphins.ply"`.
It will run the the program with the `PLY` file that containing
the vertices and faces of the model.
* `FILE` must contain an argument. If no argument is passed
for the `PLY`, it will not show the model.
